Abstract

Enhancing efficiency in modern healthcare systems is essential to improve patient outcomes and reduce treatment delays. This project presents an Automatic Medicine Vending Machine designed to provide fast, accurate, and secure access to prescribed medicines. The system verifies patient login credentials linked to a doctor’s prescription and automatically dispenses the correct medication in the required quantity. A simple web-based interface ensures ease of use and improves overall patient experience.

Introduction

In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, patients often face long waiting times at hospitals and pharmacies, leading to frustration and potential medication errors. Manual dispensing processes increase delays and reduce efficiency. To address these challenges, this project proposes a medicine dispensing system similar to an ATM machine, installed in hospitals and healthcare centers.
The system allows patients to quickly retrieve prescribed medicines and complete payment at the same time, reducing human intervention, minimizing errors, and improving service efficiency.
